- **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose between three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each difficulty level adjusts the speed of the game for a more challenging experience.
- **Back Home Button:** A "Back Home" button allows players to return to the main menu at any time, providing a seamless user experience.
